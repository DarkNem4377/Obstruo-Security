# 🛡️ Obstruo

**Obstruo** is a privacy-first, system-wide website blocking application for Windows, built to help individuals and families protect themselves from harmful online content — without surveillance, tracking, or cloud dependency.

Obstruo operates at the operating system level, applying restrictions across **all browsers and apps**, while keeping full control local to your device.

## 🛑 Microsoft Defender Notice

Because Obstruo is a **new, unsigned Windows application**, Microsoft Defender or SmartScreen may initially display a warning.

This is expected behavior for early-stage independent software.

### How to proceed safely:
1. When prompted, click **“More info”**
2. Select **“Run anyway”**
3. (Optional) Verify that the installer was downloaded directly from the official website above

Obstruo does **not** include malware, telemetry, or background network activity.  
Code signing will be introduced in a future release once distribution stabilizes.

## 🔐 Security & Stability

Obstruo is designed with **safety, resilience, and predictable failure behavior** in mind.

That said, this is an early public release and may still contain bugs or edge cases.  
If you encounter crashes, unexpected behavior, or security concerns, please report them via **GitHub Issues**.
