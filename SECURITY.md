**# 🔐 Security Policy

Obstruo is designed as a privacy-first, local-only application with a strong emphasis on predictable behavior and user safety.

While care has been taken to design Obstruo responsibly, no software is immune to bugs or security issues.

## 📣 Reporting a Security Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, privacy issue, or behavior that could compromise user safety, please report it responsibly.

**How to report:**
- Open a GitHub Issue and clearly label it as **Security**
- Do **not** publicly disclose details that could be exploited by others

We will review all security reports in good faith and aim to respond in a reasonable timeframe.

## 🔒 Scope & Expectations

- Obstruo operates entirely **offline**
- No user data is collected, transmitted, or stored remotely
- Configuration and protection mechanisms are enforced locally

This project is maintained by a single developer and is provided as-is. Security fixes and improvements will be prioritized when identified, but no formal SLA is guaranteed.

## ⚠️ Responsible Use

Obstruo is intended as a protective and supportive tool.
It is not designed to bypass operating system security boundaries or enforce restrictions beyond the limits of the host system.

Users are encouraged to keep their operating system up to date and follow general security best practices.
