# 🔐 Security Policy

Obstruo is designed as a **privacy-first, local-only Windows application** with a strong emphasis on predictable behavior, minimal attack surface, and user safety.

While care has been taken to design and test Obstruo responsibly, no software is immune to bugs or security issues.

## 📣 Reporting a Security Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, privacy issue, or behavior that could compromise user safety, please report it responsibly.

**How to report:**
- Open a GitHub Issue and clearly label it as **Security**
- Do **not** publicly disclose exploit details before review

All reports are reviewed in good faith. Reasonable efforts will be made to investigate and address valid issues.

---

## 🔒 Security Scope & Guarantees

- Obstruo operates entirely **offline**
- No user data is collected, transmitted, or stored remotely
- No telemetry, analytics, or background network communication
- Configuration, enforcement, and logging are handled locally

The application does **not** attempt to bypass operating system security boundaries and relies on standard Windows mechanisms where applicable.

## 🛑 Windows Defender / SmartScreen Notice

Because Obstruo is a **new, unsigned desktop application**, Windows Defender or SmartScreen may display a warning during download or first execution.

This behavior is expected for early-stage independent software and does **not** indicate malicious activity.

Users should ensure the installer was obtained **only from the official website or repository**.  
Code signing will be introduced in a future release once distribution stabilizes.

---

## ⚠️ Responsible Use

Obstruo is intended as a **protective and supportive tool**.

It is not designed to:
- Circumvent operating system safeguards
- Enforce restrictions beyond the limits of the host system
- Replace parental supervision, education, or personal responsibility

Users are encouraged to keep their operating system up to date and follow general security best practices.
